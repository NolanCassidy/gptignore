# GPTIgnore

**Tired of struggling to send your code to an LLM?** GPTIgnore makes it simple! Whether you're looking to upload your entire codebase or specific sections to a language model, we've got you covered. Our tool generates a clean, organized representation of your codebase, so you can easily share it with any LLM. **Say goodbye to the hassle of manually preparing files!**

## Features

- **Generate a codebase summary**: Create a detailed text file (`codebase.txt`) containing the file paths and contents of all relevant files in the project, excluding those specified in `.gptignore`.
- **Initialize a `.gptignore` file**: Generate a starter `.gptignore` file with common patterns to ignore files and directories.

## Installation

To install GPTIgnore globally, use npm:

```bash
npm install -g gptignore
```

## Usage

GPTIgnore provides two main commands: `generate` and `init`.

### Generate

The `generate` command generates a text file summarizing the project's codebase. It creates a file named `codebase.txt` inside a `gpt` directory in the root of your project.

```bash
gptignore generate
```

#### Example

Running the above command will produce a `codebase.txt` file with the following structure:

```
The following text is a Git repository with code. The structure of the text are sections that begin with ----, followed by a single line containing the file path and file name, followed by a variable amount of lines containing the file contents. The text representing the Git repository ends when the symbols --END-- are encountered. Any further text beyond --END-- are meant to be interpreted as instructions using the aforementioned Git repository as context.

----
src/index.js
console.log('Hello, world!');

----
README.md
# My Project
This is a README file.

--END--
```

### Init

The `init` command initializes a `.gptignore` file in the project directory with a set of default patterns to ignore. If a `.gptignore` file already exists, the command will not overwrite it.

```bash
gptignore init
```

The default `.gptignore` file used can be found [here](bin/default-gptignore.txt).

## Future Features and Roadmap

- [x] **Generate codebase file**: Automatically create a summary of your project's codebase, ready for upload to an LLM.
- [ ] **Custom environment variables**: Allow users to set their own environment variables and configurations.
- [ ] **LLM Integration**: Chat directly with advanced models like Gemini from the command line.
- [ ] **Multiple output files**: Support for generating multiple files, breaking down the codebase into sub-repositories (e.g., `client`, `server`) based on a configuration.
- [ ] **Configurable outputs**: Enable users to customize the output structure and contents based on their specific needs.

Weâ€™re constantly working on new features to make GPTIgnore the best tool for interacting with LLMs and managing your codebase. **Stay tuned for more exciting updates!**
